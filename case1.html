        <h8>Eco-Friendly Ecommerce Mobile App</h8>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The purpose of this mobile app is to encourage users to buy and
          replace household items with eco-friendly products to reduce their carbon footprint.
          The goal is to encourage shoppers to change their shopping behaviors by making it convenient.
          Also, gamifying the experience to provide users insight into how their purchases are positively affecting environment.

        <p>My Role: Research, Strategy, Design, Prototyping, and Testing</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>01 Problem</h6>
        <br>
        <p>The problem is in convincing users to purchase products that will reduce harmful chemical waste and their carbon foot.
          Educating users on how their shopping behaviors are contributing to the problem and easing the change of that behavior.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h6>02 Solution</h6>
        <br>
        <p>To solve for this, a mobile app was designed to find the best deal on eco-friendly products for the household in local
          markets and online. Changing users behaviors involves showing the significance of their purchases. This is accomplished by
          using an eco-pointing system for each purchase made to show users how their shopping behaviors can positively affect our
          environment by replacing items with ECO-friendly products.

      <h6>01 Competitive Analysis</h6>
      <p>This Competitive Analysis reviews both apps, GoodGuide and Instagram. In designing a mobile app that doesn't exist
        I had to get creative with the competitive analysis. I found only one mobile app somewhat similar to my product approach.
        Also, Instagram is a competitor because there are product reviewers and ads within the app geared toward users.

      <br>
      <br>
      <h7>SWOT Analysis: Good Guide</h7>
        <br>
        <p>GoodGuide is a mobile app that is closest to the product idea I am working on. They product users with an app that allows
          you to search for any product by entering the name, scanning a UPC code, browsing categories, and viewing stored bookmarks.

        <p>Instagram is a mobile app that allows its users to review products to influence their shopping behaviors.
          In addition, the app follows your likes and interest to offer ads based around products you are likely to purchase.
          This app will be a competitor to my product design and a great resource for research.

        needed before narrowing down a few great options.
