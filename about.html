        <h4>How did I become a UX Designer?</h4>
        <br><p>Growing up, I felt a divide between my two strongest desires; committing myself to an altruistic service or mastering a creative path. In college, I focused my career goals within Psychology and creative arts. I felt a strong need to engage in humanitarian pursuit but didn't’ want to give up creative exploration. I have always been fascinated by the psychology of motivation and utilizing behavior modification techniques for goal setting or self-improvement. I had this desire to combine psychology with a creative pursuit but at the time I was unsure what this career goal would look like. </p>

        <h4>What triggered a career change?</h4>
        <br><p>In 2008, I graduated with a Bachelors of Arts in Psychology from the University of South Florida. After graduation, I spent ten years in project-management-type roles in Technology, Marketing, and Learning Experience Design. During this period in my career, I discovered User Experience Design and how this role combined both of my passions and interests. I knew this was my career move and took action by enrolling in Bloc’s Design Track. In 2018, only half-way into my program I started my first job as a UX UI Designer. I am happy to report that my new role now combines my need to understand and help others with my desire to find creative solutions. I couldn't be any happier!</p>

      <section class="section3">
        <h4>What motivates me to be a UX UI designer?</h4>
        <br><p>In my new role, I am learning research techniques from Benchmarking the User Experience to understand users behaviors, how that data can be used to influence change in product design, and balancing this knowledge with the long-term goal of our products and business needs. My design skills are challenged daily to modify my approach and evolve my techniques with each new project tackled. I have room to grow here and welcome that opportunity.</p>

        <h4>What's next?</h4>
        <br><p>My long-term goal is to develop mastery within the field of UX Research and Design. The next step in my career will be to attend Kent State University’s online program Masters of Science in UX Design in 2019. While continuing to develop skills in my current role so I can become a lead designer in the near future.</p>
