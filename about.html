        <h5>Want to learn more about me?</h5>
        <br>
        <h7><i>Read on for my journey into UX Design.</i></h7>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          I have always been interested in understanding human behavior and motivation. In college, I majored in Psychology
          after taking many creative art electives. I was unsure of the career path I would follow but hoped to combine psychology
          and a creative pursuit in some way. After graduation, I spent ten years in project-management-type
          roles in Technology, Marketing, and Learning Experience Design working with many designers and
          developers. At this point in my career, I discovered User Experience Design and how this role
          combined both of my passions and interests. I knew this was the direction I wanted to take my career in and took action by
          enrolling in Blocâ€™s online Design Track.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In 2018, only half-way into my program I was offered my first job as a UX Designer with ConnectWise.
          This new role now combines my need to understand others with my desire to
          find creative solutions. I am learning research techniques from Benchmarking the User Experience,
          how to use that data to influence change within product design, and balancing this knowledge with the
          long-term goal of our products and business needs. My design skills are challenged daily to modify my
          approach and evolve my techniques with each new project tackled. I have room to grow and welcome that opportunity.

        <h5>What's next?</h5>
        <br>
        <p>
          My long-term goal is to develop mastery within the field of UX Research and Design. The next step in my
          career will be to attend a graduate program in 2019 while continuing to develop skills in my current role
          so I can become a lead designer in the near future.
