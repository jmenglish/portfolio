      <h7>Survey Summary</h7>
      <p>
        The survey findings show that participants behavior differently with Cloud Storage and Organizational services depending on their personal versus business needs.
        However, all users made it clear they do not use these services strictly for professional reasons. In addition, desktop usage was rated higher than mobile and tablet use.
        This makes sense for students or professionals in need of creating documents, sharing, and collaborating with others. They don't need the limitations other devices would introduce.
        It is clear that participants are most interested in a desktop service that is flexible to their different roles and responsibilities.

    <section class="user-testing">
      <h6>01 Moderate Testing</h6>
      <br>
      <p>With the in-person/remote user testing, the participants completed three tasks: sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and
        organize a form of content to the dashboard. They were encouraged to speak their thoughts out loud on the experience of navigating through
        each page. With this approach to testing, I could observe the exact areas of the test participants struggled with and ask prompting questions to collect data.

      <h6>02 Perference Testing</h6>
      <br>
      <p>A Preference Test, was preferred to gather insight on the features that participants would find most useful. This testing tool was utilized to help make the best design
        for users and keep moving forward. Participants voted on UsabilityHub for their preferred design. User insight was gathered on the content layout, features, and design choices for the dashboard.
      </p>

        The results were very helpful in guiding the evolution of wireframes and in finalizing design choices. For example, [talk about recent dashboard designs]
