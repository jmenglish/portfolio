      <br>
      <p>Users are in need of a Cloud Storage and Organization
        service to store personal items  and memories freeing
        up space and decluttering their devices due to the
        ever-evolving volume of information we accumulate in
        our day-to-day lives.
      </p>

      <h6>Solution</h6>
      <br>
      <p>Prism Space simplifies the process of upload and storing
        information and makes sharing content social and engaging.
        Users can upload documents and photos to share with other

      <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The following competitors were studied for this project: Google Drive, EverNote, and Dropbox.
        The research was performed with a user survey sent out to contacts via social media outlets and Reddit.
        The focus of the survey was to get an understanding of users current behaviors, users preferences, and
        note any missing features that would be an asset to participants.

      <p>
      The findings show that participants use competitor services to store personal information such as documents, research and notes.
      Creating and collaborating come second to users. It is clear that participants are most interested in storing documents and pictures
      for safekeeping and to share with others. They want the security of saving memorable items and the social aspect of sharing them. I
      suspect that saving information off of their devices to increase storage space and keep information secure is the valuable end goal.

      <h5>Wireframes to Mockups</h5>
      <br>
      <p>The wireframes went through many iterations to determine the content to include
        and in what format that would best serve the user. The iterations underwent preference
        tests to narrow down the most functional options.  The feedback gathered from the Wireframe
        User Testing was used to improve on and drive the direction of the high-fidelity designs.
        In this round of iterations, improvements to areas that were inconsistent or did not function
        well for users were addressed.

      <h6>HomePage</h6>
      <p>The homepage included two versions that were tested against each other to find the most
        user friendly experience. In the first version, all of the content was included in a one-page
        layout to reduce user scrolling, provide company info, product features within view with plan
        options up front. In the second version, the focus was solely on the product's features and
        testimonials with additional service information moved to a separate page. The preference test
        showed that a majority of participants preferred a one-page layout regardless of extra scrolling.
        They wanted to see all content in one location which would minimize clicking, highlight the features,
        and introduce pricing. With this feedback, the homepage was updated to focus on product features,
        customer testimonials, and plan details.

        <h6>Dashboard</h6>
        <p>There were many versions of the dashboard to narrow down how to display the features appropriately.
          User testing was utilized to find the optimal layout for users to easily access items for sharing or
          collaborating. A majority of participants stated that all information in view on the dashboard would
          simplify navigation making it more accessible by reducing unnecessary steps. Also, it would be easier
          to organize and find all content within view. These limitations were removed changing the folder
          structure to give users control of organizing content, naming their content, and by placing all features
          (upload, create, share, and collaborate) in the immediate view. The design was modified to group actions
          together in an ellipsis drop-down menu eliminating separate pages.

      <h5>Testing Approach</h5>
      <p> There were two types of testing performed for this case study: Recorded User testing and UsabilityHub preference
        tests. User testing for this product was performed for desktop only of both the home page and dashboard of this product.
        In hindsight, testing should have included mobile because the participants on the survey frequently used mobile apps (such as Google Drive).
      </p>
      <br>
      <h6><b>Remote/In-person Testing</b></h6>
      <br>
      <p>With the in-person/remote user testing, the participants completed three tasks: sign up for an account, add a piece of content, and
        organize a form of content to the dashboard. They were encouraged to speak their thoughts out loud on the experience of navigating through
        each page. With this approach to testing, I could observe the exact areas of the test participants struggled with and ask prompting questions to collect data.
      </p>
      <br>

      </p>
      <br>
      <h6><b>Perference Testing</b></h6>
      <br>
      <p>For the Preference Test, participants voted on UsabilityHub for their preferred design. User insight was gathered on the content layout, features,
        or design choices for both the homepage and dashboard. The results were very helpful in guiding the evolution of wireframes and in finalizing design choices.
        For example, I started to question the original layout of the homepage and created a second option to include a more creative design with the images and content.
        A preference test was used to gather feedback on which UI experience user's preferred. The results showed that a large majority of participants enjoyed the original
        layout because it was simple and more natural to read the information. In the end, my doubts about the initial homepage design was discredited by the participant's approval. Lesson learned!

      <h5>Lessons Learned</h5>
      <br>
      <p>In the beginning of this project, I made the assumption that users would want a tool mainly to
        create and collaborate on their business and personal ideas. The survey results proved my theory
        to be incorrect and change the direction of this project. Also, I overlooked the amount of users that
        preferred the mobile app of competitors over web-based services. Testing was focused on web-based designs
        but mobile should have been included as well.
